### CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity & Availability) Model with Diagram

In cybersecurity and information security, the CIA Triad is a foundational model that outlines the three core principles for protecting information.

#### Confidentiality - Keep data secret

- **Tools:**AES256, SSL/TLS, access control, MFA
- **Threats:** Social engineering, keyloggers, IoT backdoors

#### Integrity - Data is not altered, keep accuiracy

- **Tools:** Checksums, message digests (MD5, SHA1/2), digital signatures
- **Threats:** Code injection, encryption attacks

#### Availability - Data accessible when needed

- **Tools:** IPS/IDS, patch management, redundancy, HA
- **Threats:** DDoS, hardware failure, application failure

| **Component**       | **Meaning**                                  | **Goal**                                                         | **Example**                                                  |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Confidentiality** | Ensure only authorized users can access data | Prevent unauthorized access, leaks, or spying                    | Using encryption, passwords, and access control lists (ACLs) |
| **Integrity**       | Ensure data is accurate and unchanged        | Prevent unauthorized modification or tampering                   | Checksums, hashes (e.g., SHA-256), digital signatures        |
| **Availability**    | Ensure systems and data are accessible       | Prevent outages and ensure legitimate users can access resources | Redundant servers, load balancing, backups, DDoS protection  |

![CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity & Availability) Model with Diagram](/01-CC/img/domain-1/cia-triad.png)

### Opposite of CIA Triad is DAD (Disclosure, Alteration & Destruction)

- **Disclosure:** Unauthorized access
- **Alteration:** Data changed
- **Destruction:** Data or systems destroyed

It's also need to know for security.

| **Component**   | **Meaning**                                             | **Purpose**                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Disclosure**  | Unauthorized access to information                      | Violates **confidentiality** |
| **Alteration**  | Unauthorized modification of information                | Violates **integrity**       |
| **Destruction** | Unauthorized removal or denial of access to information | Violates **availability**    |

### IAAA – Identity & Access (Identification, Authentication, Authorization, and Accountability)

- **Identification:** Who you are (username, ID, SSN)
- **Authentication:** Prove it (MFA recommended)
  - **Type 1 (Knowledge):** Passwords, PINs, passphrases
  - **Type 2 (Possession):** ID cards, tokens, single-use passwords
  - **Type 3 (Biometrics):** Fingerprint, iris, face
- **Authorization:** What you can access (DAC, MAC, RBAC, ABAC, Context/Content-based)
- **Accountability:** Track actions → non-repudiation, Traces an Action to a Subject's Identity.

> **Biometric Notes:**

- **Errors:**FRR (False Reject), FAR (False Accept), CER (Crossover Error Rate)
- **Types:** Physiological (fingerprint, iris), Behavioral (typing rhythm, gait)

4. Accountability, example - Traces an Action to a Subject's Identity.

### Privacy

In cybersecurity, Human right; protection from unauthorized observation or intrusion. Privacy refers to the rights and control individuals have over their personal information, including how it is collected, used, stored, and shared.

**`General Data Protection Regulation` (GDPR):** It is a comprehensive legal framework enacted by the European Union (EU) that governs how organizations collect, process, and protect the personal data of individuals within the EU and the European Economic Area (EEA).

**Individual Rights Under GDPR**

The regulation grants several key rights to individuals, including:

- **Right to Access:** The right to see what data an organization has about them.
- **Right to Erasure:** Also known as the "right to be forgotten," allowing individuals to ask for their data to be deleted.
- **Right to Portability:** The right to move their data from one service provider to another.
- **Right to Rectification:** The right to have inaccurate personal data corrected.

#### Privacy vs Confidentiality

| **Aspect**         | **Privacy**                                        | **Confidentiality**                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Focus**          | Protecting personal or sensitive information       | Preventing unauthorized access to data             |
| **Concerned With** | Data ownership, user rights, and consent           | Data security and access control                   |
| **Legal Basis**    | Often governed by privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) | Typically enforced by security policies            |
| **Example**        | GDPR compliance, cookie consent                    | Encryption, firewalls, access control lists (ACLs) |

### Risk Management?

Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and controlling threats to an organization's digital assets, systems, and data. The goal is to reduce the likelihood and impact of cybersecurity incidents. Risk calculation by following formula;

- `Risk` = `Threat` x `Vulnerability (Likelihood)` Or
- `Risk` = `Threat` x `Vulnerability (Likelihood)` x `Impact`
- `Total Risk` = `Threat` x `Vulnerability (Likelihood)` x `Asset Value`
- `Residual Risk` = `Total Risk` - `Countermeasures`

**Key Components**

1. `Asset` 👉 Example: database, server, credentials
2. `Threat` 👉 Example: hacker, malware, insider
3. `Vulnerability` 👉 Example: open port, weak password
4. `Impact` 👉 Example: data loss, downtime

#### Risk Lifecycle: Identify → Assess → Respond → Monitor

- **Qualitative:** Likelihood & impact (High/Medium/Low/Extreme)
- **Quantitative:** Assign numeric cost ($), calculate ALE, SLE, TCO
- **Risk Response:** Accept, Mitigate, Transfer, Avoid (Never reject)

**Indicators: In Summary Table**

| Acronym | Full Name                 | Purpose                  | Example                                 |
| ------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| KPI     | Key Performance Indicator | Tracks ongoing progress  | Number of sales calls per week          |

| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Identify Risks**   | Discover vulnerabilities, threats, assets, and potential attack vectors   |
| **2. Assess Risks**     | Evaluate likelihood and impact `Risk = Likelihood × Impact`               |
| **3. Prioritize Risks** | Rank risks based on criticality and business impact                       |
| **4. Threat Risks**     | Choose mitigation strategy: avoid, transfer, mitigate, or accept the risk |
| **5. Monitor & Review** | Continuously track risk posture and update strategies as threats evolve   |

#### Risk Assessment

Risk Assessment is the process of evaluating risks to determine their likelihood, impact, and priority so organizations can decide how to manage them. `Two` ways measeure risk like

![Risk Assessment Process](/01-CC/img/domain-1/risk-assessments.png)

1. **Qualitative Risk Analysis** It's a subjective method used to `prioritize risks` by `evaluating` their `likelihood` and `impact` using descriptive scales (e.g., `Low`, `Medium`, `High`) rather than numerical data.

**Key Characteristics**

- No complex calculations (unlike ARO, ALE)
- Uses ratings (High/Medium/Low)
- Fast and easy to perform
- Based on expert opinion and experience
- Often visualized using a risk matrix

**Example**

| Risk         | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------ | ---------- |
| DDoS Attack  | High       | High   | Critical   |
| Data Leak    | Medium     | High   | High       |
| Laptop Theft | Low        | Medium | Medium     |

**Risk Matrix Concept**

| Likelihoods | Low Impact | Medium Impact | High Impact |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| High        | Medium     | High          | Critical    |
| Medium      | Low        | Medium        | High        |
| Low         | Low        | Low           | Medium      |

**When to Use**

- Early stage risk assessment
- When data is limited
- Quick decision-making needed
- Business-level discussions

1. **Quantitative Risk Analysis** It's a `systematic`, `data-driven` process that evaluates risks by `assigning numerical values`vsuch as monetary `cost`, `time impact`, or `probability` to determine their potential effect on project objectives.

It provides an objective and detailed assessment of risk exposure, particularly in complex environments, by applying analytical techniques such as `Monte Carlo simulation` and `Expected Monetary Value` (EMV).

## Domain 3 Access Controls Concepts

### Access Controls

Access Control is the process of deciding `Who` can access `What` resources and `How` they can use them.

#### Basic Components

| Component   | Meaning                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Subject** | User / system requesting access   |
| **Object**  | Resource (file, database, system) |
| **Action**  | Read, write, execute              |

#### Access Control Process Flow - IAAA

1. `Identification` → Who are you? (Username)
2. `Authentication` → Prove it (Password, biometrics)
3. `Authorization` → What can you access?
4. `Accounting (Auditing)` → What did you do?

#### Access Control Categories

| Type                           | Description                                          | Example                                |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
